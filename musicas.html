        So where are you?<br>
It's been a little while<br>

Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical<br>
Beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical<br>
Moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

Lovin' what I'm tastin'<br>
Venom on my tongue<br>
Dependant at times<br>
Poisonous vibrations<br>
Help my body run<br>
I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>

Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical<br>
Beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical<br>
Moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

Fall out of formation<br>
I plan my escape<br>
From walls they confined<br>
Rebel red carnation<br>
Grows while I decay<br>
I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>

Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
Felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
The lead is terrible in flavour<br>
But now you double as a papermaker<br>
I despise you sometimes<br>
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like<br>

Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibes slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical<br>
Beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical<br>
Moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Moment is medical, yeah<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>

Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Feed us a chemical, yeah<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
Moment is medical, yeah<br>

I'm so sorry, I forgot you<br>
Let me catch you up to speed<br>
I've been tested like the end of<br>
A weathered flag that's by the sea<br>

Can you build my house with pieces? I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces? I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces? I'm just a chemical<br>
Can you build my house with pieces? I'm just a chemical<br>
